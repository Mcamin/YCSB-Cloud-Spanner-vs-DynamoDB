Getting Started
---------------

1. Download [YCSB](https://github.com/madtomy/YCSB):

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/madtomy/YCSB
    ```
    
2. Set up a database to benchmark. There is a README file under each binding 
   directory.

Building from source
--------------------

YCSB requires the use of Maven 3; if you use Maven 2, you may see [errors
such as these](https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/issues/406).

YCSB requires the use of JDK and not JRE on Windows.

On windows, Make sure to add JDK as `JAVA_HOME`, 
and the maven, and jdk paths to the `Path` variable 
in your System variables

To build the cloudspanner database binding:

    mvn -pl com.yahoo.ycsb:cloudspanner-binding -am clean package

To build the dynamodb database binding:

    mvn -pl com.yahoo.ycsb:dynamodb-binding -am clean package

To build Both dynamodb and cloudspanner:
   
    mvn clean package


4. Run YCSB command. 

    On Linux:
    ```sh
    bin/ycsb.sh load basic -P workloads/workloada
    bin/ycsb.sh run basic -P workloads/workloada
    ```

    On Windows:
    ```bat
    bin\ycsb.bat load basic -P workloads\workloada
    bin\ycsb.bat run basic -P workloads\workloada
    ```

  Running the `ycsb` command without any argument will print the usage. 
   
  See https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/wiki/Running-a-Workload
  for a detailed documentation on how to run a workload.

  See https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/wiki/Core-Properties for 
  the list of available workload properties.
